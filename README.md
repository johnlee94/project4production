**Approach Taken**

Set up users model first for authentication/authorization. Added user, challenge, request model to back end. Wired up challenges to interact properly with front end. Added search functionality using yelp fusion's API. Reworked front end for challenges model. Currently working on adding full CRUD to challenges model for front end (back end already configured). Cheers!

**Known Bugs**

Location address not passed properly to back end

Cannot search if certain fields are left blank

**Coming Soon**

Filter search by categories (like ascending by price)

Add full CRUD for challenges

Add expiration functionality to challenges

Requests Model!

Friends Model!

Better Style!
